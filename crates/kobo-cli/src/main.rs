Cobalt
======

Everything is in this folder, on the same partition your books are on. It is
visible from any computer over USB.

To remove it completely: delete this folder. Nothing was written to the
system partition, no start-up script was added, and no part of the reader was
replaced, so there is nothing else to undo.

To start it: run start.sh. If you have NickelMenu installed, add this one line
to .adds/nm/menu to get an entry in the reader's own menu:

  menu_item :main    :Cobalt    :cmd_spawn    :quiet:/mnt/onboard/.adds/cobalt/start.sh

Starting Cobalt stops the stock reader for the length of the session and
starts it again afterwards. That takes twenty to thirty seconds each way. A
reboot always returns you to the stock reader.

const INSTALL_INSTRUCTIONS: &str = "\
To install on a device:
  1. Charge it. The reader refuses to install anything on a low battery, and
     it does so silently.
  2. Connect it by USB and copy this file to .kobo/KoboRoot.tgz on the drive
     that appears.
  3. Eject the drive. The device installs it at the next boot and restarts.

Everything lands in .adds/cobalt on the same drive. Deleting that folder is a
complete uninstall; nothing is written to the system partition.";
