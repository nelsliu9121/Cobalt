//! Driving a running application and getting the panel back as a picture.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! Everything in this workspace could be tested except the one thing it is
//! for: what a reader actually sees. A layout assertion proves a button was
//! placed; it does not prove the screen reads as a product. The only way to
//! close that loop -- for a person, or for something automating on their
//! behalf -- is to drive the application the way a finger does and look at the
//! result.
//!
//! Both halves of that already existed and neither was reachable. The
//! simulator has run the device's own renderer and refresh planner since the
//! beginning, and it has served the frame over HTTP the whole time; what was
//! missing was a way to say "tap Search" rather than "tap 536, 912", and a way
//! to get 1.5 megabytes of raw grey out as something openable.
//!
//! # Why taps go through coordinates
//!
//! A driver that dispatched actions straight into the application would be
//! simpler and would be worthless. It would pass on a screen whose only button
//! had been laid out four millimetres below the bottom edge of the panel,
//! which is precisely the fault this is for catching. So a step names a
//! control, this resolves the name against the layout the renderer produced,
//! and then taps the middle of the rectangle it actually occupies -- through
//! the same touch transform and the same hit-testing a finger goes through.
//! If the control is not reachable, the tap misses, and the script fails.
