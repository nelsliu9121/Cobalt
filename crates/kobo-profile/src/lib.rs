/// A value here is a composition of two separate facts, and only one of them

/// upright reports 1, with every geometry field unchanged, and it flips as the

/// So a variant here is correct as written only at the rotation it was
/// measured at, named by `reference_rotation`. At any other rotation in the
/// profile's `verified_rotations` it is composed with the half-turn delta by
/// [`PanelPose`], which is what keeps this field honest now that `validate`
/// accepts more than one pose. Both halves were confirmed on the Libra 2
/// panel on 2026-08-22: the digitiser measured panel-fixed by corner at both
/// poses, and rendered marks at rotation 3 appearing diametrically opposite

/// The geometry below is the portrait state. Six of these fields move when the
/// reader is rotated: `width` and `height` exchange, `virtual_width` becomes
/// 1696 and `virtual_height` 1280, `stride` becomes 6784, and `rotation`
/// becomes 2. One rule covers both: the stride is the visible row rounded up
/// to 128 bytes, and the virtual width is that stride divided by four. So 1264
/// pixels is 5056 bytes, rounded to 5120, giving 1280; and 1680 pixels is 6720
/// bytes, rounded to 6784, giving 1696. The virtual height is the visible
/// height rounded up to 128 pixels. `memory_length` does not move, being
/// allocated once at the larger of the two products, and neither do the
/// bitfields or the touch ranges, since the controller reports in panel
/// coordinates whatever the screen is doing.
///
/// So this profile matches the device in portrait and rejects it in landscape.
/// Nothing about that is specific to the Libra 2, since every Kobo rotates and
/// nothing here sets the mode it wants: `FBIOGET_VSCREENINFO` is read and
/// `FBIOPUT_VSCREENINFO` is never sent, so whatever the previous application
/// left is what gets validated. Relaxing the comparison would not be a fix on
/// its own, because `rotation` also selects the touch transform in
/// `touch_to_display`, so a device accepted at the wrong rotation would have
/// its touch input placed wrongly.

/// bounded display stages, wait timing, guardian restoration, an end-to-end
