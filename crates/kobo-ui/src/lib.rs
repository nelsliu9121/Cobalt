// Threading a scale through all of them would work exactly until one call site
// was missed -- and the symptom of missing one is not a compile error, it is a
// page measured at one size and drawn at another, which loses its last lines
// off the bottom of the panel with nothing to say they were ever there.
//
// So it sits beside the typeface, which is ambient for the same reason and has
// been all along. A frame is laid out and drawn in one pass on one thread, and
// the scale is set at the top of that pass, so the whole of a frame is always
// measured at one size.
// It is per-thread rather than per-process for the same reason it exists at
// all: a second thread measuring a page at its own size would otherwise cut
// this one's page to a size it was never laid out at, and the result is the
// same lost lines by a different route. A frame belongs to the thread drawing

        added a second process, because the lock was in the wrong address space. If you are \
