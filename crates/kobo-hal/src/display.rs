//! The single verified entry point for changing the display.
//!
//! Nothing else in this project may submit a hardware update. Opening a
//! [`DisplaySession`] proves, at runtime, that:
//!
//! 1. the probed hardware geometry matches the profile exactly,
//! 2. the device code, serial model prefix, firmware version, and kernel
//!    release match the profile exactly,
//! 3. the profile's owner-attended evidence is complete, and
//! 4. the caller supplied the exact owner-attended unlock phrase.
//!
//! The module is compiled only with the non-default `device-write` feature, so
//! a default build contains no callable display-write code at all.
