#![forbid(unsafe_code)]

//! Reading and writing JSON, with no dependencies and no way to panic.
//!
//! The runtime has exactly two reasons to speak JSON: the book catalogue at
//! `gutendex.com`, whose search responses are a few hundred kilobytes of
//! nested arrays and objects, and the `OpenAI` chat completions API, whose
//! request bodies carry text the reader typed and whose responses carry
//! arbitrary unicode. Both are hostile inputs in the sense that matters: they
//! arrive over the network and nothing on the device gets to check them first.
//!
//! ## Why this is not serde
//!
//! The workspace keeps its crates.io dependencies few and confined to the
//! crates that need them, so that a device binary is a plain
//! `cargo build --target armv7-unknown-linux-musleabihf` away and so that the
//! surface that has to be trusted stays small. A derive-macro JSON stack would
//! add a whole serialization framework to save code that fits in one file.
//!
//! ## What is guaranteed
//!
//! * [`parse`] returns `Ok` or a [`ParseError`] for every possible `&str`. It
//!   does not panic, it does not recurse without a bound, and it contains no
//!   `unsafe`.
//! * Recursion is capped at [`MAX_DEPTH`] containers, so a reply that is
//!   nothing but ten thousand opening brackets is refused in constant stack.
//! * [`escape_into`] writes a complete, correctly escaped JSON string literal.
//!   A chat message containing a quote, a backslash or a newline cannot end
//!   its own string or add a field to the request that surrounds it, which is
//!   the whole reason request bodies are built from a [`Value`] rather than
//!   from `format!`.
//! * Serialisation uses an explicit stack rather than recursion, so a value an
//!   application built by hand, which never passed through the parser's depth
//!   ceiling, cannot overflow the stack on the way out. Dropping such a value
//!   still runs `Vec`'s recursive drop glue, which is outside this crate's
//!   reach and one more reason to keep values inside the parser's ceiling.
//!
//! ```
