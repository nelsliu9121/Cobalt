//! Real type for the panel.
//!
//! # Why this is a separate crate
//!
//! `kobo-ui` decides what a heading is; this crate decides what a heading looks
//! like. Keeping the split means the layout engine, the SDK, the protocol and
//! every application stay free of external dependencies, and the rasteriser can
//! be replaced without any of them changing. This is the same containment used
//! for `kobo-net`, and for the same reason: one crate carries the risk.
//!
//! # Why the device's own font
//!
//! The panel is 300 pixels per inch. The built-in fallback in `kobo-ui` is a
//! 5x7 bitmap with no lowercase at all, which is legible on a terminal and
//! insulting on an e-reader. The device already ships 47 TrueType faces,
//! including Atkinson Hyperlegible, which the Braille Institute designed
//! specifically so that similar letterforms cannot be confused. Reading a file
//! that is already on the device is not redistribution, so there is no
//! licensing question to answer, and there is nothing extra to install.
//!
//! If no face is found, `kobo-ui` keeps its fallback rather than failing. Text
//! that is ugly is better than an application that will not start.
//!
//! # Why the monospace face is embedded instead
//!
//! The same argument does not survive contact with the device. Of the 40-odd
//! faces the firmware ships, **not one is monospaced**, checked, not assumed.
//! A character grid cannot be faked from a proportional face: forcing a common
//! advance leaves `i` swimming in space and `m` touching its neighbours, and a
//! terminal is precisely where column alignment carries meaning.
//!
//! So this one face travels with us. `DejaVu Sans Mono` is redistributable, and
//! its licence is shipped beside it in `fonts/`. It also covers the box-drawing
//! block, which is what stops a full-screen program drawing its frame as a
//! column of question marks.
