//! One reading surface, shared by every application that puts a document on
//! the panel.
//!
//! [`kobo_doc`] turns a file into a [`Document`], and [`kobo_read`] turns a
//! `Document` into pages, a place that survives the book being closed, a table
//! of contents, highlights and a dictionary. Between the two sits a stretch of
//! work that is neither parsing nor reading, and that every application was
//! expected to write for itself: reserving room for the illustrations before
//! any of them have been decoded, decoding them slowly enough that the panel's
//! watchdog stays asleep, handing the pixels to the runtime under the handle
//! the page reserved, and giving all of it back when the book is closed.
//!
//! That stretch is about two hundred and fifty lines, and the first
//! application to need it wrote them. The second application to need it --
//! arXiv, whose papers are HTML with figures in them -- would have written
//! them again, slightly differently, and the device would have had two
//! readers that behaved almost alike. This crate is the seam that stops that:
//! applications hold a [`BookView`], hand it bytes, and get the reader
//! everything else on the device already has.
//!
//! # What it opens
//!
//! Whatever [`kobo_doc::read`] opens, which today is EPUB, HTML, Markdown and
//! plain text, sniffed from the name and the leading bytes. A format added
//! there arrives here without this crate changing; PDF is the one people ask
//! for and the one that has no backend yet, so [`BookView::open_bytes`] on a
//! PDF fails the same way an unreadable EPUB does rather than pretending.
//!
//! # Pictures that are not in the file
//!
//! An EPUB carries its illustrations inside the container, so a book opens
//! with every plate already in hand. A web page does not: `<img src="x1.png">`
//! is a promise to fetch something, and [`kobo_doc::html`] leaves
//! [`Document::images`] empty because a parser is not allowed to touch the
//! network. Such a document opens immediately with its figures standing in as
//! their own descriptions, and the application fetches the names
//! [`BookView::missing_pictures`] gives it, hands each one back through
//! [`BookView::provide_picture`], and calls [`BookView::settle_pictures`] when
//! the batch is done. The book is measured once more at that point, and the
//! reader stays on the block they were reading rather than the page number
//! that block used to be on.
