//! A message sent in light, one letter at a time.
//!
//! The reader has a front light, and the front light is the only output on the
//! device that carries across a room. This turns it into a beacon: type a
//! message, and it goes out as Morse, the panel showing whichever letter the
//! light is sending at that moment.
//!
//! ## Why a beat is a whole second
//!
//! Morse is defined against a unit: a dot is one, a dash is three, and the
//! silences between are one, three and seven. Every one of those is a duration
//! the application has to wait out, and the only timer this platform offers an
//! application is `Task::Sleep`, which counts whole seconds. There is no way to
//! run work off the callback thread and no sub-second wake, so the unit here is
//! one second and cannot currently be anything else. That makes the beacon slow
//! -- `SOS` takes twenty-seven seconds -- and slow is the honest speed rather
//! than a setting that lies about what the runtime can do.
//!
//! Slow turns out to be the right answer anyway. The SDK's own guidance is that
//! flashing the front light is a photosensitivity hazard, and the hazard band
//! starts around three flashes a second. A one second unit puts a run of dots
//! at half a hertz, which is an order of magnitude clear of it.
//!
//! ## Why the letter is a picture
//!
//! The point of the screen here is to be read from across the room by somebody
//! who is not holding the device, so the letter wants the whole panel. The
//! largest type this platform sets is [`kobo_ui::FontSize::Heading`] at 5.4 mm,
//! which is a heading and not a signal, and pictures are never enlarged to fit
//! -- `fit_within` returns a small source untouched. So the letter is drawn
//! here, at the size it will be seen, out of a five by seven block alphabet.
//! Blocks rather than a real face because a glyph made of filled rectangles
//! costs a memset and needs no typesetter, and at this size the difference is
//! invisible.
//!
//! The picture is rebuilt when the *letter* changes, not when the light does.
//! That is what keeps the panel calm: a message of ten letters repaints ten
//! times across two minutes rather than once a second for the whole run.
