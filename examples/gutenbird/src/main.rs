//! Gutenbird: an OPDS client for the device.
//!
//! Read the Open Publication Distribution System -- the shape nearly every
//! ebook library on the open web answers in -- rather than one website's own
//! JSON. Project Gutenberg, Standard Ebooks, Open Library and the OPDS
//! conformance catalogs are built in; a reader may add any other by URL. See
//! `docs/OPDS.md` for why this changed and what the real catalogs actually do,
//! and `SPEC.md` for the shape this application follows.
//!
//! ## Why the interface never says which version answered
//!
//! OPDS comes in two incompatible wire formats -- Atom for 1.2, JSON for
//! 2.0 -- and `kobo_opds` reads both into one [`kobo_opds::Feed`]. Nothing on
//! this panel is allowed to ask which parser produced it: no badge, no screen
//! that exists for one version and not the other, no wording that changes
//! because a language arrived as `dcterms:language` rather than
//! `metadata.language`. A reader who adds a catalog should never be able to
//! tell which specification it implements.
//!
//! ## Why an EPUB is worth the wait
//!
//! This used to stream Project Gutenberg's plain text, because a zip archive
//! cannot be read until its last byte has arrived and the text could be shown
//! from the first one. That trade is no longer the right one: `kobo-doc` can
//! now read an EPUB, and throwing away every heading, every italic and the
//! table of contents in exchange for a first page a few seconds sooner is not
//! a trade most readers would choose if it were put to them plainly. An EPUB
//! is fetched in pieces, assembled whole, and only then opened; plain text
//! remains a fallback for the catalogs -- and there are real ones -- that
//! publish nothing else.
//!
//! ## Why the reading screen is not built here
//!
//! Type size, front light, bookmarks and marked passages are not gutenbird's
//! to invent -- every application that shows a book wants the same ones, and a
//! reader who learns them in one should find them in the next. They live in
//! `kobo-read`.
