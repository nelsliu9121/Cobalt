//! The framework launcher.
//!
//! This is deliberately an ordinary application written against `kobo-sdk`.
//! It gets no privileged drawing path, no private widgets and no hardware
//! access the counter example could not also ask for. The only thing that will
//! eventually distinguish it is a permission to enumerate and start other
//! applications. If the launcher cannot be expressed with the public SDK, the
//! SDK is not good enough yet, so keeping it honest here is the point.
//!
//! Returning to the stock reader is a first-class, always-visible destination
//! rather than something hidden in a menu. The reader is not an application and
//! cannot be one: it owns the framebuffer, input, power and Wi-Fi while it
//! runs, and its lifecycle belongs to vendor init. Showing it again means
//! ending this session and restarting it. Making that the most obvious control
//! on the screen also makes it the most exercised path in the system, which is
//! exactly where the reliability is wanted.
