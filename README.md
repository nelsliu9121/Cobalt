Cobalt is an open-source application platform for Kobo. It provides a launcher,
an App Store, a Rust SDK, a runtime with capability isolation, and a Clara BW
simulator.

See the [public roadmap](ROADMAP.md) for the product outcomes Cobalt is working
toward and the principles used to choose them.

After one USB installation, users can install, update, and remove signed apps
over Wi-Fi. App releases are independent from Cobalt platform releases, so a
new app can appear in Store without reinstalling or updating Cobalt.

## Features

- Signed Wi-Fi app installation, updates, and removal
- Shareable app pages with encrypted QR or pairing-code installation
- Separate Settings-based updates for the Cobalt platform
- Apps run as separate unprivileged processes
- Per-app capability checks for network, storage, audio, frontlight, and other
  device services
- Declarative e-ink UI toolkit and browser simulator
- Profile-driven full and partial refresh planning for supported panels
- Static ARMv7 binaries with no device-side package manager
- Recovery-safe app and catalog transactions

## How it differs

[NickelMenu](https://pgaskin.net/NickelMenu/) adds actions to Kobo's stock
menu. [KOReader](https://koreader.rocks/) and
[Plato](https://github.com/baskerville/plato) are reading apps. Cobalt is a
platform for building and installing apps.

Cobalt handles the common parts: screens, app lifecycle, drawing to the e-ink
display, partial refreshes, touch input, device access, process isolation,
testing, and signed installs. App authors can focus on their app instead of
building those parts again.
See the [FAQ](https://bandarlabs.github.io/Cobalt/faq.html) for a fuller
comparison.

## Apps

Every screenshot below is a real capture from a Kobo Clara BW. Store manages
the installable applications; Settings and Terminal remain protected system
utilities.

### Suggest an app

What would you use on your Kobo? It could be a game, a reading tool, a
home-automation control, or a replacement for an Android or iOS app. Add it to
the [app request thread](https://github.com/BandarLabs/Cobalt/issues/41).

## Install

Install [rustup](https://rustup.rs), let it install the stable Rust toolchain,
then add the ARM target and connect a charged, fully supported reader over USB.
You do not need a separate operating-system `rust` package; rustup supplies
`rustc` and `cargo`:

```sh
rustup toolchain install stable
git clone https://github.com/BandarLabs/Cobalt.git
cd Cobalt
rustup override set stable
rustup target add armv7-unknown-linux-musleabihf
cargo run -p kobo-cli -- setup
```

Restart the reader and open **Cobalt** from Kobo's menu. Future applications
are installed from **Store** over Wi-Fi. Full Cobalt updates remain under
**Settings**.

If you already use NickelMenu, Cobalt is added to it; existing entries are
left alone.

See [docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md) for the complete walkthrough and
recovery steps.

## App Store

Store reads a signed catalog from the fixed `app-catalog` GitHub release. Each
package contains one ARM executable and a signed canonical manifest. The
runtime verifies the catalog, package, installed manifest, and binary before
launch.

Store is the only app-management surface. The applications bundled with the
first `0.2.0` platform install appear as installed, can be removed and
reinstalled in the same session, and can be updated in place without creating
a second launcher entry. Platform utilities such as Settings and Terminal are
shown as installed system apps and cannot be removed.

Open **Install links** in Store to link a phone or computer without an
account. The **Install** button on any
[Cobalt app page](https://bandarlabs.github.io/Cobalt/#apps) then sends an
encrypted request to that Kobo. If the reader is offline, reconnect it and
open Store within 72 hours to continue.

Apps are published automatically when an app PR is merged into `main`.
Publishing an app does **not** require changing the Cobalt version or creating
a platform release.

Sudoku remains Store-only and is intentionally absent from the USB platform
package, so installing it verifies delivery of an app that was not already on
the reader.

## Build an app

```sh
cargo install --path crates/kobo-cli
kobo new my-app
cd my-app
kobo dev
```

`kobo dev` runs the app in the Clara BW browser simulator. Start with the
[SDK documentation](https://bandarlabs.github.io/Cobalt/sdk.html); the
repository also keeps the [deep implementation guide](SDK.md).

### What the SDK provides

| Area | Application-facing support |
|---|---|
| App model | Ordinary Rust binaries with declarative screens, named actions, lifecycle callbacks, and runtime-managed Back navigation |
| E-ink UI | Measured text, rows, tiles, pictures, dialogs, keyboards, terminal views, pagination, and full or partial refresh planning |
| Network and credentials | Asynchronous HTTPS fetches and posts, ranged downloads, bounded responses, and named secrets whose values never enter the app |
| State and background work | Atomic per-app keyed storage, cancellable tasks, foreground/background lifecycle events, and scheduled wake capabilities |
| Device and media | Capability-gated battery, cover, frontlight, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and audio requests |
| Tooling | App scaffolding, the browser and native runtime simulators, layout diagnostics, deterministic failure scenarios, packaging, and device deployment |

Apps request services through the SDK instead of opening device resources
directly. The runtime can deny a request because it was not declared, is too
expensive for the current battery state, or is unsupported, and each refusal
is returned to the app as a value it can present or recover from.

See the SDK docs for the
[application model](https://bandarlabs.github.io/Cobalt/sdk.html#application-model),
[UI components](https://bandarlabs.github.io/Cobalt/sdk.html#ui),
[runtime services](https://bandarlabs.github.io/Cobalt/sdk.html#services),
[capabilities](https://bandarlabs.github.io/Cobalt/sdk.html#capabilities),
[developer-facing crates](https://bandarlabs.github.io/Cobalt/sdk.html#crates),
and the [CLI command reference](https://bandarlabs.github.io/Cobalt/sdk.html#cli).

## Contributing apps

App contributions are regular pull requests:

1. Add the app as a workspace package under `apps/<app-id>/`.
2. Add its release metadata to `apps/catalog.json`.
3. Add unit tests and layout checks for every affected supported profile.
4. Run the app in the browser and runtime simulators.
5. Run it on a physical, fully supported Kobo and attach a GIF, video, or
   photos to the pull request.
6. Include one clean panel screenshot for the app README and generated website
   install page.
7. Open a pull request.

After the PR is reviewed and merged, the `Publish apps` workflow builds every
registered app for ARM, signs the packages and catalog, and updates the fixed
Store channel. App versions are independent from the Cobalt platform version.

See [docs/CONTRIBUTING_APPS.md](docs/CONTRIBUTING_APPS.md) for metadata,
capabilities, testing, and release details.

## Safety and support

Cobalt does not replace Kobo's boot chain. Device support is explicitly gated
by hardware and firmware identity, and a reboot returns to the stock reader.
The first installation still modifies files on the user storage partition and
is provided without warranty.

Normal panel-write entry points require one of the exact hardware and firmware
combinations in the
[device support matrix](docs/DEVICES.md#device-support-matrix). Do not treat a
read-only profile match as permission to install: normal use requires the
profile's owner-attended display, touch, exit, and recovery evidence to be
complete.
